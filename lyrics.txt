They're Pinky and the Brain
Yes, Pinky and the Brain
One is a genius, the other's other insane
They're laboratory mice
Their genes have been spliced
They're Pinky, they're Pinky and the Brain
Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain

Before each night is done
Their plan will be unfurled
By the dawning of the sun
They'll take over the world

Before each night is done
Their plan will be unfurled
By the dawning of the sun
They'll take over the world

They're Pinky and the Brain
Yes, Pinky and the Brain
Their twilight campaign is easy to explain
To prove their mousy worth
They'll overthrow the earth
They're Pinky, they're Pinky and the Brain
Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, narf
